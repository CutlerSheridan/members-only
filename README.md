# Members Only

## A message board with varying degrees of accessibility depending on if user is signed in, a club member, and/or an admin

Post messages. If you're not signed in, you can view messages, but not who posted them. If you are signed in and a club member, you can see who posted them. If you're an admin, you can delete them, too.

Made using Node, Express, MongoDB, Passport, bcryptjs, EJS, HTML, CSS.
